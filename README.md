This is an implementation of a simple shell using C programming language

The following files have been used for implementing the shell

1. get_input.c - this is used to get input from the user from stdin
2. split_strings.c - this is responsible for spliting the input gotten into tokens
3. execute_command.c - this executes the commands passed into the shell
4. exit.c - used for exiting the shell
5. loop.c - this calls all the functions needed for proper functioning of the shell
6. main.h - contains all the necessary header files and macros needed
7. main.c - calls all the other functions listed above and serves as the entry point
